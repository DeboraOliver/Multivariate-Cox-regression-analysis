The purpose of the model is to evaluate simultaneously the effect of several factors on survival
The Cox proportional-hazards model  is essentially a regression model commonly used statistical in medical research for investigating the association between the survival time of patients and one or more predictor variables.Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, which works for both quantitative predictor variables and for categorical variables. Furthermore, the Cox regression model extends survival analysis methods to assess simultaneously the effect of several risk factors on survival time.
The purpose of the model is to evaluate simultaneously the effect of several factors on survival. In other words, it allows us to examine how specified factors influence the rate of a particular event happening (e.g., infection, death) at a particular point in time. This rate is commonly referred as the hazard rate. Predictor variables (or factors) are usually termed covariates in the survival-analysis literature.
